    Osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and bone fragility rob millions of their mobility, healing potential, and quality of life. 

    Yet current treatments ignore a critical piece of biology: the vascular microenvironment that supports bone regeneration.

    **Nimverta is developing a first-in-class peptide therapy that simultaneously regenerates bone and vasculature.** 

    By leveraging natural physiological pathways, our approach unlocks a new future for long-term, safe treatment of skeletal disease.
