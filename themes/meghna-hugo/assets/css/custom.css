/* =================================== */

/* 1. Make sure the card container fills the full height of its grid column.
   The parent '.row' is a flex container, so its children (the col-* divs)
   are already the same height. This makes the card fill that space. */
.team-member {
  height: 100%;
  
  /* 2. Turn the card itself into a vertical flex container.
     This allows us to control the space distribution of its children (photo and meta). */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* 3. Target the text content area of the card. */
.team-member .member-meta {
  /* 4. Tell this section to "grow" and take up any available extra vertical space.
     This is the magic part that pushes the button to the bottom. */
  flex-grow: 1;

  /* 5. Also make THIS a flex container to align its own children. */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
