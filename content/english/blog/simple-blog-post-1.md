**Nimverta**, a Zurich-based biotech startup, has secured CHF 10,000 in funding from [Venture Kick](https://www.venturekick.ch), entering a new phase in its journey to develop first-in-class peptide therapies for bone regeneration. The support is part of [Venture Kick’s Stage I](https://www.venturekick.ch/CHF-10000-for-firstinclass-peptide-therapeutics-E-coli-vaccine-cold-chain-logistics-a-software-for-diplomats-and-therapies-for-bone-disease), designed to catalyze high-potential Swiss startups.

Founded by **Dr. Amit Singh**, with **Prof. Anjali Kusumbe** as Chief Scientific Officer and **Rob Chisholm** as Chief Business Officer, Nimverta targets age-related bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and bone fragility. The company’s innovation lies in its dual-regeneration approach — addressing both bone and the supporting vasculature, which conventional treatments neglect.
