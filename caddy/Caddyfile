# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

# :80 {
# 	# Set this path to your site's directory.
# 	root * /usr/share/caddy
# 
# 	# Enable the static file server.
# 	file_server
# 
# 	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
# 	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080
# 
# 	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
# 	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
# }

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile

# nimverta.com {
#     reverse_proxy localhost:1313/New_hugo/

# nimverta.com {
#     root * /home/ubuntu/New_hugo/public
#     file_server

# nimverta.com {
#     # Set the root to the new, correct public web directory.
#     root * /var/www/nimverta.com
#     
#     # Enable the static file server.
#     file_server

# Listen for both www and non-www versions.

    # If the requested host is www.nimverta.com...
